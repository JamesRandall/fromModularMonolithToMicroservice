## A Bit About Me

* Working "Cloud First" since 2011
* Ran a lean startup inside an enterprise (good way to lose hair)
* Worked as a consultant in a variety of organisations from enterprise integration through to hyper-scale eCommerce
* Currently work as an independent consultant: 
  * Architecture / code consultancy
  * Problem solving
  * End to end product / solution development

-----

## What Is A Modular Monolith?

* A unit of software that addresses multiple concerns
* Internally decomposed into isolated modules or subsystems
* Significant proportion of intra-subsystem communication occurs in-process
* The modules and subsystems deploy and scale together
* A system, as perceived by a customer, may be made up of only one of these

-----

## What Are Micro Services?

* A unit of software that addresses a single concern
* Deploys and scales independently to other services
* Communication with other systems occurs via APIs(REST, queues, events etc.) and usually over a network
* A system, as perceived by a customer, may be made up of tens, hundreds or even thousands of micro-services

-----

## Why From Modular Monolith To Micro Service

* I spent time working:
    * With small teams struggling for market fit
    * In large organisations with hundreds of developers where the primary challenge was scale - technical, volume and organisational
* And saw:
    * Micro services slow small projects to a crawl and become impediments to addressing actual challenges    
    * Micro services help large projects scale - both technically and organisationally
    * Monoliths help kick start small projects
    * Traditional monoliths grow from small to large becoming an ever more crippling and frail millstone
    * Monoliths expensively rewritten into micro services

-----

## Development is a Journey

* The needs of a product, system and team change over time
* There isn't a "one size fits all" answer, its all about the right tradeoffs
* What's beneficial at one point in time can be an impediment at another
* Acknowledging that - can we optimise for the journey?

## Typical Monoliths

* Tend to use layered architecture (sometimes called onion layer)
* Decoupling occurs using interfaces and an IoC container e.g.
    * StoreService implements IStoreService and makes use of an IStoreRepository implemented by a StoreRepository
* As they get larger services begin to rely on other services and things get quite spaghetti like
* Cross cutting concerns (e.g. logging) are often:
    * Implemented as services themselves and injected into other services with each service (ILogger) sometimes using a decorator approach
    * Or they use features of the container framework (e.g. filters in ASP.NET Core)

-----

## What Are The Downsides of This approach

* None of these things are inevitable but:
    * They have a habit of turning into spaghetti and early attempts to wall off sub-systems tend to break down
    * It can be difficult to apply generic / abstract code to the per service interface approach
    * They tend to have a lot of boilerplate
    * It can be hard to decouple from the container technology

-----

## Creating A Modular Monolith that Can Evolve Into Micro Services

* Express operations using state 
* Use assemblies and access modifiers (public, internal, etc.) to define boundaries that are enforceable through easy static analysis
* Communicate (sub-system) operations through a mediator
* Describe sub-system communication using configuration
* Reduce boilerplate by addressing cross-cutting concerns with the mediator
    * Avoid coupling cross-cutting concerns, where possible, to container frameworks - keep them portable

# Decomposing Into Micro Services

* To demonstrate how the approach we've adopted can facilitate decomposition into isolated services we'll pull out the notification and product subsystems
* To keep things clear this example is slightly artificial:
    * I have kept things in a single solution
    * I have used project references
* In a real world solution each subsystem would be:
    * Isolated in its own git repository
    * Expose API contracts as swagger documents, JSON schema, and/or NuGet client packages

## Summary

* When designing a system consider your current challenges, capabilities, and likely direction of travel
* Expressing operations as state allows for a great deal of flexibility
* Focus on being DRY and cleanly separating concerns - it will make it easier to evolve your system
